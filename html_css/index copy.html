        <h2>Whats happening?</h2>
        <p>The Blackening follows a group of Black friends who reunite for a Juneteenth weekend at a remote cabin in the woods. Two of them, Morgan and Shawn, arrive early and discover a strange board game called The Blackening. Soon after, the lights go out and a masked voice forces them to play the game. When Shawn answers a question incorrectly, he is killed, and Morgan is captured and held hostage by the person running the game.
The next day, the rest of the friend group arrives at the cabin to begin the weekend celebration. On the way, Shanika invites an old college acquaintance named Clifton after running into him at a gas station. The group spends time joking, drinking, and catching up, unaware of what already happened to Morgan and Shawn. Everything seems normal at first, but the isolated setting and strange events create an uneasy feeling.
That night, the power suddenly shuts off, and the group is led to the game room where they hear the same mysterious voice. The voice reveals that Morgan is alive but being held captive, and the only way to save her is by playing The Blackening. The game asks trivia questions, and wrong answers lead to violent consequences. The friends realize they are trapped and must continue playing if they want to survive.
After failing a question, the group is told they must sacrifice someone, specifically the person considered the “most Black.” Instead of choosing one of their close friends, they decide on Clifton, who already feels like an outsider. Clifton is shot with an arrow and appears to be killed, which deeply upsets the group but allows the game to continue.
The remaining friends attempt to escape and look for help, but they are hunted through the woods. Some of them encounter a park ranger who seems willing to help, but he is quickly killed. As the group keeps running and fighting back, they discover that there is more than one attacker involved, making escape even more difficult.
In the end, the friends learn that Clifton is actually alive and was behind the entire game. He staged his death and planned everything as revenge for being excluded by the group in the past. The friends confront him and manage to defeat him, freeing Morgan and escaping the cabin. They survive the night and leave the woods shaken but alive.

        <p>I really enjoyed watching The Blackening because it was both funny and entertaining from start to finish. Even though it is technically a horror movie, it did not feel overwhelmingly scary. Instead, the movie focused more on comedy, which made it easier to enjoy without feeling tense the whole time. The jokes and characters made the experience feel more like a fun movie night rather than a traditional horror film.
One of the best parts of the movie was how the humor balanced out the scary moments. Whenever something intense or violent happened, the movie usually followed it with a joke or an awkward situation that made the audience laugh. This helped lower the fear factor and kept the movie from becoming too dark. Because of this, the scary aspects never felt too heavy or uncomfortable.
The characters also played a big role in why the movie was so funny. Their conversations felt natural and relatable, like real friends joking around with each other. The way they reacted to danger was humorous because it showed panic mixed with sarcasm and honesty. This made the characters feel realistic and made their situations more entertaining to watch.
Another reason I enjoyed the movie was how it used comedy to make fun of horror movie clichés. Instead of taking everything seriously, the movie leaned into exaggeration and self-awareness. This made scenes that would normally be frightening feel clever and amusing instead. The humor made the movie stand out from typical horror films that rely only on fear.
Overall, The Blackening was enjoyable because it successfully mixed comedy and horror in a way that worked well. The funny moments outweighed the scary ones, making the movie entertaining instead of stressful. I found myself laughing more than being scared, which made it a really fun movie to watch.

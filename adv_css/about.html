        <h2>The Reasoning</h2>
        <p>The creator of The Blackening wanted to change how Black characters are usually shown in horror movies. For a long time, horror films have followed the stereotype that Black characters die first, and this movie was made to call that out. Instead of taking a serious or dramatic approach, the creator used comedy to make fun of those stereotypes. By doing this, the movie shows how unfair and repetitive these horror tropes are while still being entertaining for the audience.
Another meaning of the movie is about Black identity and the idea of what it means to be “Black enough.” The creator included this theme to show that there is no single way to be Black. The characters are all different, and the movie jokes about how people are sometimes judged based on how they act, talk, or dress. This helps the audience understand that stereotypes are harmful and don’t represent real people.
The movie also focuses on giving Black characters more control in the story. In many horror movies, Black characters are not given much depth and are often used just to move the plot forward. In The Blackening, the characters are aware of horror movie rules and try to survive instead of making obvious mistakes. The creator wanted to show Black characters as smart and capable rather than helpless.
Comedy is very important to the message of the movie. The creator used humor to talk about serious issues like racism and stereotypes without making the movie feel too serious or uncomfortable. Laughing helps the audience stay engaged while still thinking about the message behind the jokes. This shows that comedy can be used as a powerful way to share important ideas.
Another intention behind the movie was to celebrate Black culture. The movie includes jokes, references, and moments that are meaningful to Black audiences. At the same time, it is still enjoyable for people from different backgrounds. The creator wanted Black viewers to feel represented and included in a genre that has often ignored them.
Overall, the creator of The Blackening wanted to challenge stereotypes and change the horror genre. The movie sends a message about representation, identity, and awareness while still being funny and entertaining. It shows that horror movies can be creative and meaningful at the same time, and that Black characters deserve to be more than just side characters in scary films.
